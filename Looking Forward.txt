Problems to solve:
Weight nodesize, not just fontsize [[fixedsize=false should make node size dependent on font size]]
Figure out better formula for converting weight to fontsize (currently just multiplying weight by 32)
Figure out how to visualize the larger (philosophers) dataset [[use single powerful computer]]
#Weight arrows according to the average of the two nodes ??
Colourcode ??

splines=polyline
nodesep=.01
fixedsize=false

Just change weight to a function of page length

Create new dataframe, add row iff row$influenced %in% row$name
